## What is a e s t h e t i c, or even vaporwave for that matter?

Let's start with vaporwave.  Vaporwave a genre of music made in one of the corners of internet, for the internet.
It's as if an electronic genre crossbred with a meme.  It's not above stealing...I mean sampling. So let me sample Wikipedia for the rest:
"The style is defined by its appropriation of 1980s and 1990s mood music styles such as smooth jazz, elevator music, R&B, and lounge music, typically sampling or manipulating tracks via chopped and screwed techniques and other effects."
It's style and sound meant to make you the feel as if you're in a shopping mall.  And is there any place you'd rather be than a mall in 1991? Of course not.
And so what about those a e s t h e t i c s? Again, I sample Wikipedia:
" Its surrounding subculture is sometimes associated with an ambiguous or satirical take on consumer capitalism and popular culture, and tends to be characterized by a nostalgic or surrealist engagement with the popular entertainment, technology and advertising of previous decades. It also incorporates early Internet imagery, late 1990s web design, glitch art, anime, 3D-rendered objects, and cyberpunk tropes in its cover artwork and music videos."
